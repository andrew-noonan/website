## Template usage
Website template taken (with permission) from my friend Nishan Shehadeh 
https://github.com/nshehadeh/nshehadeh.github.io/tree/master


## Basic Usage
npm run dev -> local testing
npm run deploy -> build (create dist folder) and push to gh-pages for github actions to take effect

For editing you should only have to edit src/App,jsx for most of content
Store source files (pics, gifs, etc.) in public/

Only tweaks I had to make for deployment were playing with the "base" path in vite.config.js
